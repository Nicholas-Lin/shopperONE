This Chrome extension provides realtime visual feedback for items found on Amazon that do not fall within the user's predefined budget. By providing feedback before a purchase is made, impulsive shopping decisions are mitigated.

* 52% of millennials were more likely to make impulse purchases than any other generation
* Over half of US shoppers have admitted to spending $100 or more on an impulse buy
* Impulse purchases represent almost 40% of all the money spent on e-commerce

We used React.js alongside Capital One's Nessie API for user authentification and Chrome local storage for data persistence.
